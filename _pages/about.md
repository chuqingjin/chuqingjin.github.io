I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Boston University. I will be a post-doc in the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University starting Fall 2022. My research falls at the intersection of industrial organization and applied econometrics. I create models to help understand the incentives for competition in different industries such as finance and public cloud. In particular, I am interested in models that build on deep institutional knowledge and yield empirical findings to guide policy. For example, in the financial industry, I use micro-data to disentangle analystsâ€™ incentives for information provision and derive implications for competition policies.

* Does Competition Between Experts Improve Information Quality? Evidence from the Security Analyst Market

  * *Financial analysts are rewarded for being* ***the most accurate****. This leads them to distort their forecasts to differentiate themselves from their peers, but also disciplines their optimism bias. In the current market, the disciplinary effect dominates while the distortionary effect is still present, resulting in more accurate but more dispersed forecasts across analysts. It is optimal to have moderate competition between the covering analysts to both improve aggregate information and contain the distortionary effect.*

* Sticky Consumers and Cloud Welfare, joint with Peichun Wang and Sida Peng

  * *Cloud adoption creates big welfare benefits, particularly for smaller firms. However, it also induces consumers stickiness on existing product, which leads to sub-optimal product choices for all firms and reduces welfare from cloud adoption. Introductory discounts incentivizing firms to try new products and improve both consumer welfare and provider revenue.*
