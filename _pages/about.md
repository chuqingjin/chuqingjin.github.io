I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Boston University. I will be a post-doc in the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University starting Fall 2022. My research falls at the intersection of industrial organization and applied econometrics. I create models to help understand the incentives for competition in different industries such as finance and public cloud. In particular, I am interested in models that build on deep institutional knowledge and yield empirical findings to guide policy. For example, in the financial industry, I use micro-data to disentangle analystsâ€™ incentives for information provision and derive implications for competition policies.
