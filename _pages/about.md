I am a post-doc in the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University. I recently completed my PhD in Economics at Boston University. My research falls at the intersection of industrial organization and applied econometrics, with a focus on applications in the finance and technology industries. In particular, I create novel models to help understand how information frictions are generated in these industries, as well as how they affect competition and welfare. Combining these models with data, I produce empirical findings to guide policy. My job market paper uses financial analystsâ€™ forecast data to disentangle their incentives for information provision and derive policy implications for improving information quality in the financial market.

*Financial analysts are rewarded for being* ***the most accurate****. This leads them to distort their forecasts to differentiate themselves from their peers, but also disciplines their optimism bias. In the current market, the disciplinary effect dominates while both effects are present, so it is optimal to have moderate competition between analysts to both improve aggregate information and contain the distortion.*

<summary>**Sticky Consumers and Cloud Welfare**,    
with Peichun Wang and Sida Peng      
[*Under Review*]    </summary>

*Cloud computing creates big welfare benefits, particularly for smaller firms, but we find that cloud customers are sticky to old cloud products, thus undermining cloud's benefits. Cloud migration services and introductory discounts, which incentivize firms to try new products, can improve both consumer welfare and provider revenue.*
