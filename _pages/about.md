I am a fifth year PhD student in Economics at Boston University. I am interested in Empirical Industrial Organization and Applied Econometrics. I aim to understand how competition affects the quality of information and products. My current projects make use of micro-data in the financial industry and cloud-computing industry to disentangle strategic incentives from heterogeneity at various levels.
