I am an Assistant Professor at [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/). My research falls at the intersection of industrial organization and finance. I apply a wide range of empirical methods, with a focus on using structural estimation to understand welfare implications of policies and market designs. In my current research, I create novel models to help understand how information frictions are generated in finance and technology industries, as well as how they affect competition and welfare. I completed my PhD in [Economics at Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/econ/). Before joining TSE, I was a postdoctoral fellow at [Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/index.html).

* *Financial analysts are rewarded for being* ***the most accurate****. This leads them to distort their forecasts to differentiate themselves from their peers, but also disciplines their optimism bias. In the current market, the disciplinary effect dominates while both effects are present, so it is optimal to have moderate competition between analysts to both improve aggregate information and contain the distortion.*

* *Cloud computing creates big welfare benefits, particularly for smaller firms, but we find that cloud customers are sticky to old cloud products, thus undermining cloud's benefits. Cloud migration services and introductory discounts, which incentivize firms to try new products, can improve both consumer welfare and provider revenue.*

</summary>

* *We develop a novel quantitative dynamic model of demand for and supply of index funds to decompose the impact of **inertia**, **information frictions**, and **preference heterogeneity**. We find inertia is high, with only 1-3% of household updating their portfolio each month. Although inertia is high, its impact on the investment behavior of households is limited because investors struggle to optimize due to high information frictions. The introduction of ETFs lowered expense ratios through both the cost advantage and increased competition, but demand-side frictions substantially dampened its effect.*
